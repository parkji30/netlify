Experimental physicist, programming enthusiast exploring the creation and evolution of the Universe.

My current research involves the investigation of star formation using high powered telescope such as BlastTNG- https://sites.northwestern.edu/blast/. 

Currently I am working on analyzing data from our most recent flight along with developing an optimal filtering and compression algorithm that will be implemented in future models!

I also dabble with machine learning and abstract math.
